We welcome contributions of any kind! Whether it's a small bug fix, a performance improvement, a new feature, or a UI enhancement, we'd love your help.

## How to Contribute an Idea

1. **Open an issue first** — Describe your idea in a GitHub issue before diving into code. This helps us discuss the approach and ensure it aligns with the project direction.
2. **Wait for feedback** — The maintainers will review and give you the green light or suggest adjustments.
3. **Create a PR** — Once approved, create a pull request with your implementation.

This process ensures we're all aligned and prevents duplicate work or wasted effort.

## Areas You Could Improve

### 🚀 Performance

- **Page load optimization** — Reduce initial bundle size, optimize images, implement lazy loading
- **Seed data loading** — Speed up database seeding for faster local setup
- **API response times** — Optimize server actions and database queries
- **Component rendering** — Identify and optimize slow React renders
- **Caching strategies** — Add caching for frequently accessed data

### 🔒 Security

- **Input validation** — Strengthen validation in forms and server actions
- **Rate limiting** — Add protection against brute force or abuse
- **XSS/CSRF prevention** — Review and improve security headers
- **Dependency auditing** — Identify and update vulnerable dependencies
- **Access control** — Review and strengthen role-based access patterns

### 🎨 UI/UX

- **Animations** — Add smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive design** — Improve mobile experience
- **Accessibility** — Better keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast
- **Error states** — More helpful error messages and recovery flows
- **Dark mode** — Add dark theme support

### ⚙️ Developer Experience

- **Type safety** — Add stricter TypeScript checks or improve type definitions
- **Testing** — Increase test coverage with new test cases
- **Documentation** — Improve inline comments, JSDoc, or setup guides
- **Error handling** — Better error messages and debugging tools
- **Developer tooling** — Add scripts or commands to make development easier

### 📦 Services & Utilities

- **Email notifications** — Implement or improve notification delivery
- **Storage optimization** — Improve image compression or file handling
- **Timezone handling** — Better support for multi-timezone operations
- **Data validation** — Strengthen Zod schemas and validation logic
- **Seed data** — Add more realistic example data for testing

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Any bugs you discover or issues you see in the codebase

## General Guidelines

- **Start small** — First contributions don't need to be huge. Bug fixes or small improvements are perfect.
- **Follow code standards** — Check out the codebase to match existing patterns (see CONTRIBUTING.md for more).
- **Test your changes** — Make sure E2E tests and unit tests pass.
- **Write clear commit messages** — Help future maintainers understand your changes.
- **Be respectful** — Follow our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Questions?

Not sure if your idea is a good fit? Open an issue anyway! We'd rather chat about it early than have you wonder in silence.

Happy contributing! 🎉
