## 📌 Description
Create a client-side layout builder where developers can toggle Flexbox/Grid properties (e.g., `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, or `grid-template-columns`, `gap`), see their layout update in a live visual sandbox, and copy the corresponding HTML and CSS code.

---

## 🎯 Requirements

- Create a new Flexbox & Grid Generator utility page.
- Add the tool to the Dev Utilities dashboard.
- Register the required route.
- Layout:
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between **Flexbox** mode and **CSS Grid** mode.
- **Property Control Sidebar (Left)**:
- For Flexbox: Toggles for `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `gap`.
- For Grid: Inputs for columns count, rows count, `gap`, and alignments (`justify-items`, `align-items`).
- Sliders/inputs to add or remove grid/flex items dynamically.
- **Visual Sandbox (Center)**: A container displaying the configured layout with numbered child items. It should reflect all layout updates in real-time.
- **Code Output Panel (Right/Bottom)**: A tabbed interface showing the generated CSS rules and the matching HTML structure.
- Actions/Buttons:
- **Copy CSS**: Copies the generated CSS rules.
- **Copy HTML**: Copies the generated HTML markup.
- **Reset**: Returns settings to default flexbox values.
- Implementation:
- Use pure React state for reactive property bindings.
- Visual container must use inline styles matching the selections.
- Follow the existing monochrome design system (soft glassmorphism/zinc borders, consistent buttons, responsive flex-grid layouts).
- Support both light and dark themes.

## ✅ Expected Result
Users should be able to:

- Access the Flexbox/Grid Generator from the Dev Utilities dashboard.
- Select property values and see the child items reposition themselves instantly.
- Adjust the number of child items and copy ready-to-use HTML/CSS snippets.
- Use the tool completely offline.
