/**
 * Backfills createdById and createdByName on all Task rows that don't have them.
 *
 * For each un-attributed task, sets the creator to the owner of the org that
 * owns the task (i.e. Organization.owner). This is the safest approximation
 * for tasks created before the createdBy fields were added.
 *
 * Safe to run in both dev and production:
 *  - Only touches rows where createdById IS NULL (never overwrites existing data).
 *  - Uses individual updates so a single failure doesn't roll back the whole run.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-task-creators.ts
