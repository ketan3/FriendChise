 * Vitest config for integration tests.
 *
 * Integration tests run against the real dev database (seeded fresh before
 * each run). They test service functions end-to-end through Prisma without
 * mocks — verifying real DB constraints, transactions, and relationships.
 *
 * Run with: pnpm test:integration
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This seeds and dirties the dev database. Do not run against
 * production. The global setup reseeds before every run so leftover data
 * from a previous failed run is always cleaned up.
