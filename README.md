# Why FriendChise Exists

FriendChise started with a simple belief:

> The success of one location should strengthen every location.

Too often, valuable operational knowledge stays within individual stores instead of being shared across the business. New staff repeat old mistakes, successful processes remain isolated, and every location ends up solving the same problems independently.

FriendChise was built to preserve knowledge, standardise operations, and help every location benefit from the experience of the best-performing teams.

Today, FriendChise brings operational knowledge, workforce management, business tools, and collaboration together into one platform that grows alongside a business.

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Modular service architecture
- Server-side validation
- Guided demo framework
- Automated testing
